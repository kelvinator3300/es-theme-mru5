To create a custom collection from this theme (have it show up with systems
instead of in the collections group), copy this folder and rename it to
whatever you want the name of the collection to be.

For example, if you want a "Batman" collection to show up on the system menu
(not inside the Collections group), copy the "collection" folder and (re)name
the new folder to "Batman".
